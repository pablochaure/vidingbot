This repository contains Python code to automate the booking of gym classes.

## Description

Having faced many times the circumstance that the pool at my gym was fully booked by people making reservations really fast and I could not enjoy going there in the summer months, I decided to automate such task with the help of the Selenium library in a Python script.

This was my first time automating tasks in a web browser with Selenium and, with the help of the documentation and other similar projects online, I was able to successfully automate my gym reservations.
